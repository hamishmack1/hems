# hems

The aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility of deploying optimization routines on edge devices for HEMS scheduling applications.

## to-do:

1. Modify optimisation routine 2 to train models for EVERY time-step instead of entire day. This allows for fast real time execution and mitigates error introduced by poor forecasting.
2. Add a control loop/policy to optimisation routine 2.
    1. Satisfy power balance equation.
    2. State of system needs to be carried between days. Feed current battery SOC to next time step.
3. Add function that calculates cost for following scenarios:
	1. Benchmark (no PV or battery)
	2. With PV (no battery)
