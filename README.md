# hems

The aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility of deploying optimization routines on edge devices for HEMS scheduling applications.

TODO:

1. Scale PV generation historical data to more typical values. 2x, 3x, 4x, etc. - []
2. Using optimisation routine 1, test quality of output for different decision horizons. Gather cost data and graphs of decisions. Determine most suitable decsision horizon. - []
    1. All customer data (best case scenerio/benchmark)
    2. Single day
    3. Two day (rolling horizon)
    4. Four day (rolling horizon)
    5. All customer data (best case scenario)
